# Todo list

## Version 3.0.0 (last edited 2015-05-21 18:06)

* Rewrite everything in pure javascript.
	- Swap out the colorpicker for standard text input so no external libraries are needed.
* Use [autolinker.js](https://github.com/gregjacobs/Autolinker.js/) once/if it has a secure cdn.
* Smaller and faster settings.
* Keep/convert the same settings so upgrading isn't an issue.

Hopefully this will be finished later this summer.
